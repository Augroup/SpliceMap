== SpliceMap Installation ==

No installation is required if you do not wish to rebuild the binaries.
Simply copy the binaries (in the "bin" folder) to a directory of your choice.

Please see the website for tutorials and manuals

If you are having troubles running SpliceMap on your machine due to 
incompatible libraries, you will need to build it from source.
Fortunately, this pain free!

Go to the "src" directory and type "./install.sh <output_dir>".
the binaries (64-bit) will be built and copied to the <output_dir>. 
Any existing files will be overwritten. 

If you also need to build Bowtie, 
Go to the "src" directory and type "./install-bowtie.sh <output_dir>".

For the 32-bit version use "./install-32.sh <output_dir>" and 
"./install-bowtie-32.sh <output_dir>".

If the above command fails. Try "chmod +x *.sh" then try the above step again.

If you need to rebuild SeqMap, see http://biogibbs.stanford.edu/~jiangh/seqmap/
After building copy "seqmap" to the same directory as the SpliceMap binaries.
